# Figma Variables››Transporter

This is built off of a basic React/Tailwind template and uses PNPM to handle builds. If you don't have PNPM installed globally, follow [these instructions](https://pnpm.io/installation).

### Pre-requisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) – v16
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) – v7

### Developing and Building

To develop the Figma Plugin project:

```
$ pnpm dev
```

You'll need to stop and re-run `pnpm dev` if you're updating the `ui.tsx` file. If you're just updating the `code.tsx` then the dev watch will auto-update.

To build the entire Figma Plugin project:

```
$ pnpm build
```
